**Real-world example — Data Scientist**
Arjun, a Mathematics graduate, realized his resume lacked strong ML projects. SkillBridge highlighted skill gaps in statistics, feature engineering, and visualization. After completing the 4-week plan, he built two impactful datasets analyses — one of which went viral on LinkedIn — and landed interviews at 3 analytics firms.
""",
    "Machine Learning Engineer": """
**Real-world example — Machine Learning Engineer**
Neha, a backend developer, wanted to break into ML. The tool pinpointed missing skills in deployment, deep learning, and MLOps. She followed the plan, built an image classification model, deployed it via FastAPI, and showcased it in her portfolio — securing her first ML role in 2 months.
""",
    "Data Analyst": """
**Real-world example — Data Analyst**
Ravi, a fresher, found that SQL and dashboarding were his biggest gaps. Following SkillBridge’s plan, he mastered SQL joins, built a Power BI sales dashboard, and included it in his resume — which directly led to a job offer from an e-commerce company.
""",
    "Software Engineer": """
**Real-world example — Software Engineer**
Maya, a CS graduate, struggled in coding rounds. The tool flagged algorithm optimization and testing gaps. After the microplan, she solved 200+ practice problems and built a tested mini-project — helping her clear Amazon’s technical interview.
""",
    "Frontend Engineer": """
